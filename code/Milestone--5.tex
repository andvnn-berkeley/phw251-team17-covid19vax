\textbf{Project Statement}

We are monitoring COVID-19 vaccination rates among counties in
California and in relation to age. Specifically, we are interested in
whether there is any correlation between median age and vaccinated
person prevalence at the county level. Utilizing two datasets, the
California Census Data and the COVID-19 Vaccine Progress Dashboard, we
intend on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing vaccination rates at the
county level and the relationship between age and vaccination rate.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textbf{Methods}

Of the two datasets of interest, the first describes COVID-19
vaccination administration across the state of California. This is
sourced from the California Open Data Portal for the California
Department of Public Health. Relevant fields include date, zip code,
county, and raw counts of vaccination status, among other population
information. The dataset starts from January 5th, 2021 and is
continually updated to reflect new changes in the data, most recently
updated on November 23rd, 2021.

The second dataset describes demographics (e.g.~population,
race/ethnicity, age, household size, etc.) for each California county,
most recently updated in September 2021. This dataset was rehosted on
Avery Richard's GitHub, and is sourced from Census data.

Partial subsetting of data was initially completed to keep the following
variables in each dataset:
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textbf{\emph{COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard}}: Date, Zip Code, County,
Population 5+, Number of Persons Fully Vaccinated, Number of Persons
Partially Vaccinated

\textbf{\emph{County Census Data}}: Name, Median Age



\textbf{New Variables}

After subsetting the data from both sources, the data were cleaned and
new variables were created.

Data Cleaning

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Mean imputation: county-level means of fully and partially vaccinated
  that will be used to replace NA values in dataset
\item
  Percent eligible population partially vaccinated = \# of persons
  partially vaccinated / population 5+ (at county level)
\item
  Percent eligible population fully vaccination = \# of persons fully
  vaccinated / population 5+ (at county level)
\item
  Merging relational data: county demographic dataset with vaccine
  administration dataset using key variable ``county''.
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textbf{Visualizations}

The Table, ``Vaccination Rates for California Counties,'' displays the
partial vaccinated rate, fully vaccinated rate, total eligible
population, and median age of each county in California. The summarized
average rates, total eligible population, and median age for the entire
state of California is calculated and presented at the top of the table.

The scatterplot, ``Percentage of Fully Vaccinated Californians by Median
Age, 2021,'' shows the rate of fully vaccinated individuals stratified
by median age of California residents, as measured from California
Department of Public Health's latest online data repository for
COVID-19. A trend line was fitted to follow the points on the plot, and
a general trend of increasing fully vaccinated rates can be seen near
the median age of 36-38.

The map shows the rates of full vaccination, by county, symbolized by a
color ramp (from low to high rates of vaccination going from yellow to
dark red). A color ramp was made with classes of 10 percent each. A
second map shows the median age of each country, symbolized by a purple
color ramp (younger to older median age going from light purple to
darker purple). The five-step color ramp ranges from 30 to 55, with each
step covering five years of age.

This last visualization features points plotted by month and percent of
full vaccination in aggregate ZIP codes falling under four categories of
the Vaccine Equity Metric (VEM) quartiles, which is based on demographic
indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage and health vulnerability (where
1 is least disadvantaged/vulnerable and 4 and most
disadvantaged/vulnerable).

\textbf{Results}

Our analyses and data visualization shows that the highest vaccination
rates were seen among the age group between 35-40. The general trend
seen for this age group exhibited a full vaccination rate of
approximately 70-73\%, with rates seen above 75\% as well.

Outliers were seen with higher rates of vaccination, approximately 85\%
for a median age of 44. Outliers were also found for lower rates of
vaccination of approximately 25\% for the median age of 37.

In terms of geography, higher vaccination rates were seen in counties
such as San Francisco, Santa Clara, and Marin county with full
vaccination rates at or above 80\% and median ages of 38, 36, 44,
respectively. Trailing behind are the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa,
Imperial, and San Mateo with median ages of, 37, 38, 32, 39.

In terms of demographic indicators, it can be seen that rates of
vaccination follow, from highest to lowest, the order of vulnerability
derived from the Vaccine Equity Metric (VEM), from least to most --
suggesting areas of improvement for equitable vaccine delivery. The
aggregate of the least disadvantaged areas (VEM group 4) sees
vaccination rates of 77\%, whereas the most disadvantaged areas (VEM
group 1) trails behind at 59\%.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textbf{Discussion}

According to our results, the minimum median age of persons receiving
COVID-19 Vaccination in the state of California is 30, for Merced
county. The maximum age was found to be 51 in Sierra county. The overall
median for the state of California is 38. A wide range of ages was seen
in the overall analysis.
